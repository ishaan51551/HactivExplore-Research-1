# The Evolution of Computing: Embracing Serverless Architectures

## Introduction

Welcome to "The Evolution of Computing: Embracing Serverless Architectures" presentation!

In this talk, we'll explore a revolutionary paradigm in the world of computing that has been reshaping the way we develop and deploy applications: Serverless Computing, also known as Serverless Architectures.

## Background

In the not-so-distant past, building and managing servers was an integral part of application development. We had to deal with server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, which often diverted our focus from the core of our applications.

## What is Serverless Computing?

Serverless Computing is a cloud computing model where cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud manage the underlying infrastructure for you. As a developer, you can focus solely on writing code and defining when and how it should execute.

## Serverless in Action

Let's take AWS Lambda as an example. Lambda allows you to run code in response to various events, such as an HTTP request or a file upload. Here's a simple javascript example of a Lambda function:

```javascript
import json

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
    // Handle an event (e.g., an HTTP request or a file upload)
    // Perform some computation or data processing
    const result = { message: "Hello, Serverless World!" };

    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify(result)
    };
};
